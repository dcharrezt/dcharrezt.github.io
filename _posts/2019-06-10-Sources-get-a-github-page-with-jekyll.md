### In order to get a github page, I found out to great resources

* The [first one](https://pages.github.com/) will guide you through the first steps in order to set up a working *hello world* page.

* Once you have set up your repository, I recommend using [themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/) that you can easily modify to save some time, otherwise you can build your own website with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
