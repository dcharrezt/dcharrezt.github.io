* The Thirty-sixth annual conference for researchers on machine learning (ICML) is being held in Long Beach Convention Center, California, USA.
This year there were [774 papers accepted](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2019/Schedule?type=Poster), from 3424 which makes an acceptance rate of 22.6%, although every year there are most submissions the acceptance rate holds around 25%.

* [Top contributing authors](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/bn82ze/n_icml_2019_accepted_paper_stats/), This year Michael Jordan of UC Berkeley is the most contributing author with 7 accepted papers at ICML 2019, closely followed by Volkan Cevher of EPFL (École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) and Sergey Levine of UC Berkeley with six papers each. The following reddit post has detailed information about authors contribution.

* I was curious about what was the most popular number of authors per paper, as you can see only 17 papers had only 1 author, on the other hand, there is just one paper with 13 authors. The most popular number of authors per paper is between 2 and 4.

* Regarding top institution by papers accepted it was hard to match automatically institutions names so I did it manually it may not be perfect but it will give you a rough idea about the top 25 institutions with papers accepted for this ICML. I only counted at most one institutions per paper for example if a paper had five authors and all of them were from Google, this paper only counts as one paper to Google.

* It is amazing how much research is being done by Google, adding up google and deepmind accepted papers account for 200 papers which are more than 25% of accepted papers in the conference.

* Please if you find some errors just let me know in the comments although I tried my best I am a human prone to make mistakes. Thanks for reading.
